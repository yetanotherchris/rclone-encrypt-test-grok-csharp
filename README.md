# rclone-encrypt-test-grok-csharp
A small CLI tool that encrypts and decrypts using the rclone encryption defaults. 

Rclone uses a custom salt if no salt is provided, which this tool will use by default. A few similar tools:

- https://github.com/rclone/rclone
- https://github.com/mcolatosti/rclonedecrypt
- https://github.com/br0kenpixel/rclone-rcc
- @fyears/rclone-crypt

Rclone encryption uses: 
- NaCl SecretBox (XSalsa20 + Poly1305) for the file contents.
- AES256 for the filenames.
- scrypt for keymaterial.
